# GoUtils

### What is this package

This package is data structures, and common functions that I use for my personal projects
I used this extensively throughout the course I completed on Coursera called Algorithms. 
[Here](https://github.com/JonnyMurillo288/go-runner) is the work with graphs, tries, compression and more


I do not recommend using these as they are not vetted fully for errors and you are likely to find better options
I use these as references and because I know how they work for my own work
